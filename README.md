## Predicting Human-Animal Conflict in Minnesota 

By Kameron Knoll, Emily Carpenter, and Taylor Gardin 

Within the past few decades, a big movement in the ecological field has been reintroducing species within certain areas. The idea behind that being we need to prevent these animals from going extinct. This was done with the Bald Eagle population in Minnesota starting around the 1960’s. Since then, there are over 300 eagles' nest in the state and the number continues to grow. Who wouldn’t be happy to see such an incline in a publicly admired species that represents the pride of our nation. However, what happens when a predator is reintroduced, they are no doubt just as important to an ecosystem as any other animal. The wolf population being brought back to Yellowstone National Park has made the park thrive in ways we could not have imagined. The wolf population in Minnesota has also been growing in the past years, but unlike Yellowstone in Minnesota humans are a part of the ecosystem now. What we will do in this data analysis is take the population densities of people, livestock, and wolves within Minnesota and see what patterns we find.
